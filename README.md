## Features

- **Two modes**: Normal mode and Insert mode
- **Line numbers**: Shows line numbers like Vim
- **Arrow key navigation**: Works in both modes
- **Basic editing**: Insert, delete, and save text
- **File operations**: Open, save, and quit
- **Vim-style commands**: Use `:w`, `:q`, `:wq` commands

## Building

### With Make

```bash
make
```

This creates the `void` executable in the `bin/` directory.

### With Anvil

If you have [Anvil](https://github.com/dexter-xD/Anvil) build system installed, you can build using the `void.conf` file:

```bash

# build
anvil void.conf
cd build && make run

# or watch mode (auto-rebuild on file changes)
anvil -w void.conf

# or watch & run mode (auto-rebuild and execute)
anvil -w void.conf

```

The configuration is already set up in `void.conf` for easy building.

## Usage

Open an existing file:
```bash
./bin/void myfile.txt
```

Create a new file:
```bash
./bin/void newfile.txt
```
